ABOUT

    qmake is a Makefile generator used by the Qt toolkit.

    The 'qmake.vim' file provides syntax coloring for qmake project files.

INSTALLATION

    Put the 'qmake.vim' file to your $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/ directory. Then you
    can use:

        :set syntax=qmake

    To use the syntax in the current buffer.
    
    To set the syntax automatically for certain file types, such as '.pro' in
    this case, create a 'pro.vim' in $VIMRUNTIME/ftdetect/ directory and add:

        au BufRead,BufNewFile *.pro set filetype=qmake

    See ':help ftdetect' for more information.
